Overview of Project

Project:DATA PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT on loan data

Objective:The objective of this project is to develop a data pipeline that automates the process of loading, cleaning, transforming, training, and evaluating a machine learning model on loan approval data. The pipeline handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, trains a Decision Tree model to predict loan approval (Loan_Status), and evaluates its accuracy. This approach ensures efficient and repeatable model development for future datasets.

Key Activities: Data Loading: Import the loan dataset from a CSV file.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values by imputing missing numerical data with the mean and categorical data with the mode.
Data Transformation: Encode categorical variables into numeric values using Label Encoding.
Model Training: Train a Decision Tree classifier on the cleaned and transformed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy score on the test set.
Pipeline Integration: Combine all steps into a single automated pipeline for consistent and repeatable results.

Technology Used: Programming Language: Python: The main programming language for implementing the data pipeline.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and cleaning (e.g., handling missing data, encoding categorical features).
NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: A machine learning library for model training, evaluation, and encoding.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for visualizing the data distributions and insights.
Jupyter Notebook (optional): For an interactive coding environment to develop and run the pipeline.
